## Synopsis
The purpose of the Adventure Journal application is to have digital collection of your travel memories available to you anywhere you go. There are two major features available to end-users: Adventure Tracking, and Meal Tracking. 


## Adventure Tracking
This feature can be used to chronicle your adventure activities such as visiting the Grand Canyon, wine tasting at a vineyard, hiking a scenic mountain trail, checking out the latest exhibit at an art museum, and so on. You'll be able to record the following details about your adventure:
- Location (Such as City/State/Country)
- Date
- Adventure Name
- Activity Type
- Personal Thoughts
- Personal Rating

## Meal Tracking
During our travels, we often try new foods. The Meal Tracking feature allows users to log details about meals enjoyed during their adventures. This can be a handy reference for making recommendations to friends and family if they happen to travel to the same locations you've visited! Similar to adventure tracking, meal tracking will record the following details:
- Location (such as City/State/Country)
- Date
- Location Name (such as restaurant name)
- Personal Thoughts
- Personal Rating
